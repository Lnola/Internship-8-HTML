                This is one of the most popular questions submitted to this blog. It's been examined before, including by a <br>
                <a href="https://google.com" target="blank"> Science Blogs</a>
                post and a
                <a href="https://google.com" target="blank"> Straight Dope article</a>
                . They cover the kinematics pretty well. However, they don’t <br>
                 tell the whole story.
                <br> <br>
                Let’s take a closer look.
                <br> <br>
                At the start of the scenario, the entire Earth’s population has been magically transported together into one place.<br><br>

                This crowd takes up an area the size of Rhode Island. But there’s no reason to use the vague phrase “an area <br>
                the size of Rhode Island”. This is our scenario; we can be specific. They’re actually in Rhode Island.
            </p>

                At the stroke of noon, everyone jumps.

                As discussed elsewhere, it doesn’t really affect the planet. Earth outweighs us by a factor of over ten trillion. On <br>
                average, we humans can vertically jump maybe half a meter on a good day. Even if the Earth were rigid and <br>
                responded instantly, it would be pushed down by less than an atom’s width.
                <br> <br>
                Next, everyone falls back to the ground.

                Technically, this delivers a lot of energy into the Earth, but it’s spread out over a large enough area that it <br>
                doesn’t do much more than leave footprints in a lot of gardens. A slight pulse of pressure spreads through the <br>
                North American continental crust and dissipates with little effect. The sound of all those feet hitting the <br>
                ground creates a loud, drawn-out roar which lasts many seconds.
                <br><br>
                Eventually, the air grows quiet.
                <br><br>
                Seconds pass. Everyone looks around.

                There are a lot of uncomfortable glances. Someone coughs.

                A cell phone comes out of a pocket. Within seconds, the rest of the world’s five billion phones follow. All of <br>
                them—even those compatible with the region’s towers—are displaying some version of “NO SIGNAL”. The cell <br>
                networks have all collapsed under the unprecedented load.
                <br><br>
                Outside Rhode Island, abandoned machinery begins grinding to a halt.
                <br><br>
                The T. F. Green airport in Warwick, Rhode Island handles a few thousand passengers a day. Assuming they got <br>
                things organized (including sending out scouting missions to retrieve fuel), they could run at 500% capacity <br>
                for years without making a dent in the crowd.
                <br><br>
            </article>

            <article>
                The addition of all the nearby airports doesn’t change the equation much. Nor does the region’s light rail <br>
                system. Crowds climb on board container ships in the deepwater port of Providence, but stocking sufficient <br>
                food and water for a long sea voyage proves a challenge.
                <br><br>
                Rhode Island’s half-million cars are commandeered. Moments later, I-95, I-195, and I-295 become the sites <br>
                of the largest traffic jam in the history of the planet. Most of the cars are engulfed by the crowds, but a lucky few <br>
                get out and begin wandering the abandoned road network.
                <br><br>
                Some make it past New York or Boston before running out of fuel. Since the electricity is probably not on at <br>
                this point, rather than find a working gas pump, it’s easier to just abandon the car and steal the new one. Who <br>
                can stop you? All the cops are in Rhode Island.
                <br><br>
                The edge of the crowd spreads outward into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people who <br>
                meet are unlikely to have a language in common, and almost nobody knows the area. The state becomes a <br>
                patchwork chaos of coalescing and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common. Everybody is hungry and <br>
                thirsty. Grocery stores are emptied. Fresh water is hard to come by and there’s no efficient system for <br>
                distributing it.
                <br><br>
                Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.
                <br><br>
                The survivors spread out across the face of the world and struggle to build a new civilization atop the pristine <br>
                ruins of the old. Our species staggers on, but our population has been greatly reduced. Earth’s orbit is <br>
                completely unaffected—it spins along exactly as it did before our species-wide jump.
